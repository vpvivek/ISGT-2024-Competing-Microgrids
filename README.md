# Code for smart grid set up and pure algorithm

algo_5_20_5_5.py is for pure algorithm setting with No. of stages = 5, No. of states = 20, No. of actions of player1 = 5, No. of actions of player2 = 5.

smart_6_96_8_8.py is for smart grid setting with No. of stages = 6, No. of states = 144, No. of actions of microgrid1 = 12, No. of actions of microgrid2 = 12.
