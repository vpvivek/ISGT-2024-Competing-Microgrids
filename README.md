# Code for smart grid set up and pure algorithm

algo_5_20_5_5.py is for pure algorithm setting with No. of stages = 5, No. of states = 20, No. of actions of player1 = 5, No. of actions of player2 = 5. Similarly for other files.

smart_6_96_8_8.py is for smart grid setting with No. of stages = 6, No. of states = 144, No. of actions of microgrid1 = 12, No. of actions of microgrid2 = 12. Similarly for other files.

equilibrium_deviation_grid.py gives values for deviation policies from the equilibrium policy




## Dependencies

algo_error.py should be run only after algo_5_20_5_5.py, algo_5_40_5_5.py and algo_5_4_3_3.py
smartGrid_error.py and equilibrium_deviation_grid.py should be run only after smart_6_144_12_12.py, smart_6_36_6_6.py and smart_6_96_8_8.py
